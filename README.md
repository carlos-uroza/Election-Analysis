## Summary

### Election Commission Proposal

Our program can be easily and quickly adapted to perform either a more detailed analysis or expansive analysis.
1. If the election commission were to provide data for the voter reporting method, it would be possible to extend the analysis of voter turnout based on mail-in vs in-person ballots.
2. Similarly, if the election commission were to provide additional data regarding each candidates' party affiliation. It would be possible to build interactive maps for county election results accross the state.
